## Installation

This project is implemented in Haskell and built using the build tool `stack`.
You can install `stack` with your package manager of choice or by following [these instructions](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/).

You can run the (work in progress) standalone CLI application with `stack run`.
